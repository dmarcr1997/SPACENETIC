# SPACENETIC
DubHacks Blueprint Track Submission

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to show a simulated version of space to those who have had limited exposure. I wanted to implement more features, and will in the future, but for now Spacenetic allows users to view a simulated solar system and learn a little bit about orbital mechanics.
This is done through the manipulation of the orbital variables of a space craft. I set this craft's default orbit in an akward location to allow users to learn the purpose behind each variable and try to move the craft to a location that makes sense.
The second half of this project shows two planets(earth, and venus) and particles that surround them. The user can change the sizes and the number of particles that signify surface and orbital locations that are special to that planet. For fun I put inputs that changed the particle's color. I wanted to add a few more planets but could not find suitable jpg images that would work with spacekit.js.
Much of the code I wrote with spacekit was inspired by their examples and my past experience in physics and space science. 


## Software
I made this project using Vue and spacekit.js
## To get this running## 
 * fork the repo 
 * clone the code
 * open the HTML page
The CSS was fit to my computer and will not transfer well to other screens at this time. I plan of changing this in the near future and will most likely implement bootstrap or ChakraUI
